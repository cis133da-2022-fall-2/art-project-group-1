    <p>The style of filming known as One-Shot is when the crew films in very long takes using a single camera
        to give the impression that the entire film was made in one shot or sitting. While shooting certain scenes
        in only One-Shot is fairly common it's very uncommon for an entire film to be shot in the One-Shot style as
        1917 was.</p>
