<h1>1917: Review on One-shot Style!</h1>

<body>
    <P>The film 1917 makes excellent use of the continous or one-shot style of filming.
        The style was used to great effect and made the entire film feel as if it were all one shot,
        despite being multiple long shots edited together in post. The use of this style really adds to
        the emotional connection to the film and its characters. It allowes the viewer to feel as if they
        are right there In the moment with the characters experiencing what they are along side them.
