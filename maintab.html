<h1>1917: Review on One-shot Style!</h1>

<body>
  <p>
    The film 1917 makes excellent use of the continous or one-shot style of
    filming. The style was used to great effect and made the entire film feel
    as if it were all one shot, despite being multiple long shots edited
    together in post. The use of this style really adds to the emotional
    connection to the film and its characters. It allows the viewer to feel as
    if they are right there In the moment with the characters experiencing
    what they are along side them.

  <p>
    While this film does make excellant use of the one-shot style of filming
    it is far from the only example of such and many other pieces of media
    that use one-shot to great effect.
