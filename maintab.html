    <h1>1917: Review on One-shot Style!</h1>
    <p>
      The film 1917 makes excellent use of the continous or one-shot style of
      filming. The style was used to great effect - in fact - the entire film
      was all in one shot, despite being multiple long shots edited together in
      post. The use of this style really adds to the emotional connection to the
      film and its characters. It allows the viewer to feel as if they are right
      there in the moment with the characters; experiencing what they are along
      side of them.

      While this film does execute this filming flawlessly, it is far from the
      only example of many other pieces of media that use one-shot to great
      effect.
